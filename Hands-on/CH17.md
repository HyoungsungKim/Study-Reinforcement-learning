# Ch 17 Continuous Action Space

Continuous action space problems are an important subfield of RL, both theoretically and practically, because they have essential applications in robotics (which will be the subject of the next chapter), control problems, and other fields in which we communicate with physical objects.

## Why a continuous space?

In fact, when you need to communicate with a physical world, a continuous action space is much more likely than having a discrete set of actions.

## The action space

### A2C method

Returning to our action representation options, if you remember from Chapter 11, Policy Gradients â€“ an Alternative, the representation of an action as a concrete value has different disadvantages, mostly related to the exploration of the environment. ***A much better choice will be something stochastic***. The simplest alternative will be the network returning parameters of the Gaussian distribution. For N actions, this will be the network returning parameters of Gaussian distribution.
